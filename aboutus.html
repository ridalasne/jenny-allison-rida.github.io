<h1><center>Jenny Wu (Far Left) </h1></center>
<p> Haha how ironic how I'm holding a Sriracha bottle although I can barely handle hot foods! But hi friends, it's me Jenny
and I'm here to tell you a little about myself! I'm 15 years old and I'm going to be an incoming junior at Castro Valley High
School. I hope to attend UCLA in the future and become a pediatrician when I grow up. I love the Bay Area because of its culture
 and the amazing food that it has to offer. A fun fact about me is that I prefer fruit tea over milk tea and I am the
 treasurer of my school's Key Club. If I could choose anywhere to live, I would want to live in somewhere sunny in
 California like LA. My favorite trend currently is the cuffed mom/boyfriend jean, I love a distressed look. I also don't have a
 favorite artist or song because I can't choose one!

<h1><center>Allison Sibrian (Center)</h1></center>
<p>In the middle, we have a lovely picture of Allison! She is 15 years old and she's going to be an incoming junior at Middle
  Collge High School. Her dream school is to attend UCLA and become a speech therapist. She loves the Bay Area because of its
  ethnic diversity. Her favorite artists include Kanye West, Cosmo Pyke, Jaden Smith, and others. If she could live anywhere in
  the world, it would be Japan. A fun fact about her is that she enjoys watching anime and her favorite is Yuyu Hakusho.

<h1><Center> Rida Lasne (Far Right) </h1></center>
  Last but not least, we have Rida on the far right. She is 17 and is going to be a rising senior at Amador Valley
  High School. She hopes to attend USC next fall, as that is her dream school. She's partially a simpgirl because she loves sad songs and sad music in general. She loves the Bay Area because
  of how pretty and aesthetic it is naturally. Her favorite fad/trend currently is the scrunchie because it looks cute in her hair.
  A fun fact about Rida is that she doesn't like apple skin and her only social media is MySpace. She prefers to live alone and
  enjoys photography. P.S. Rida is an aspiring model so please do not judge her picture as it was very early in her modeling
  career and she was learning new poses.
